------------------------------
[spoiler=Daze ◆◆ [dice=Daze Damage]1d6+4[/dice]]
Cantrip|Enchantment|Mental|Nonlethal
somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration 1 round
You cloud the target's mind and daze it with a mental jolt. The jolt deals mental damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (1d6+4); the target must attempt a basic Will save. If the target critically fails the save, it is also stunned 1.
Heightened (+2) The damage increases by 1d6.
[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Detect Magic ◆◆]
Cantrip Detection Divination
somatic, verbal
Area 30-foot emanation
You send out a pulse that registers the presence of magic. You receive no information beyond the presence or absence of magic. You can choose to ignore magic you're fully aware of, such as the magic items and ongoing spells of you and your allies.

You detect illusion magic only if that magic's effect has a lower level than the level of your detect magic spell. However, items that have an illusion aura but aren't deceptive in appearance (such as an invisibility potion) typically are detected normally.
Heightened (3rd) You learn the school of magic for the highest-level effect within range that the spell detects. If multiple effects are equally strong, the GM determines which you learn.
Heightened (4th) As 3rd level, but you also pinpoint the source of the highest-level magic. Like for an imprecise sense, you don't learn the exact location, but can narrow down the source to within a 5-foot cube (or the nearest if larger than that).
[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Electric Arc ◆◆ [dice=Daze Damage]4d4+4[/dice]]
Cantrip Electricity Evocation
somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 or 2 creatures
Saving Throw basic Reflex
An arc of lightning leaps from one target to another. You deal electricity damage equal to 4d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.
Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d4.
[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Ghost Sound ◆◆]
Auditory Cantrip Illusion
somatic, verbal
Range 60 feet
Duration sustained
You create an auditory illusion of simple sounds that has a maximum volume equal to four normal humans shouting. The sounds emanate from a square you designate within range. You can't create intelligible words or other intricate sounds (such as music).
Heightened (3rd) The range increases to 60 feet.
Heightened (5th) The range increases to 120 feet.
[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Infectious Enthusiasm ◆◆]
Cantrip Emotion Enchantment Mental
somatic, verbal
Duration 1 round

With enchanted gusto, you encourage yourself to get things done and share your motivation with your allies. You gain a +1 status bonus to your choice of attack rolls, Will saves, or Charisma-based skill checks. During the spell's duration, an ally who observed you Casting this Spell and was within 30 feet when you did so can take a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to gain the same bonus you chose until the start of its next turn.

Using this spell to influence someone in a social situation is typically considered a faux pas, negating the benefit on Charisma-based skills if the subject of the check observed you casting the spell.
[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Light ◆◆]
Cantrip Evocation Light
somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 object of 1 Bulk or less, either unattended or possessed by you or a willing ally
Duration until the next time you make your daily preparations
The object glows, casting bright light in a 60-foot radius (and dim light for the next 60 feet) like a torch. If you cast this spell again on a second object, the light spell on the first object ends.
Heightened (4th) The object sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius (and dim light for the next 60 feet).
[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Mage Hand ◆◆]
Cantrip Evocation
somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 unattended object of Bulk 1 or less
Duration sustained
You create a single magical hand, either invisible or ghostlike, that grasps the target object and moves it slowly up to 20 feet. Because you're levitating the object, you can move it in any direction. When you Sustain the Spell, you can move the object an additional 20 feet. If the object is in the air when the spell ends, the object falls.
Heightened (3rd) You can target an unattended object with a Bulk of 1 or less.
Heightened (5th) The range increases to 60 feet, and you can target an unattended object with a Bulk of 1 or less.
Heightened (7th) The range increases to 60 feet, and you can target an unattended object with a Bulk of 2 or less.
[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Message ◆]
Auditory Cantrip Illusion Linguistic Mental
verbal
Range 500 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration see below
You mouth words quietly, but instead of coming out of your mouth, they're transferred directly to the ears of the target. While others can't hear your words any better than if you normally mouthed them, the target can hear your words as if they were standing next to you. The target can give a brief response as a reaction, or as a free action on their next turn if they wish, but they must be able to see you and be within range to do so. If they respond, their response is delivered directly to your ear, just like the original message.
Heightened (3rd) The spell's range increases to 500 feet.
[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Read Aura]
Cantrip Detection Divination
1 minute (somatic, verbal)
Range 30 feet; Targets up to 10 objects
You focus on the target object, opening your mind to perceive magical auras. When the casting is complete, you know whether that item is magical, and if it is, you learn the school of magic (pages 297-298).

If the object is illusory, you detect this only if the effect's level is lower than the level of your read aura spell.
Heightened (3rd) You can target up to 10 objects.
Heightened (6th) You can target any number of objects.
[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Shield ◆]
Abjuration Cantrip Force
verbal
Duration until the start of your next turn
You raise a magical shield of force. This counts as using the Raise a Shield action, giving you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, but it doesn't require a hand to use.

While the spell is in effect, you can use the Shield Block reaction with your magic shield. The shield has Hardness 10. After you use Shield Block, the spell ends and you can't cast it again for 10 minutes. Unlike a normal Shield Block, you can use the spell's reaction against the magic missile spell.

Heightening the spell increases the shield's Hardness.
Heightened (3rd) The shield has Hardness 10.
Heightened (5th) The shield has Hardness 15.
Heightened (7th) The shield has Hardness 20.
Heightened (9th) The shield has Hardness 25.
[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Sigil ◆◆]
Cantrip Transmutation
somatic, verbal
Range touch; Targets 1 creature or object
Duration unlimited (see below)
You harmlessly place your unique magical sigil, which is about 1 square inch in size, on the targeted creature or object. The mark can be visible or invisible, and you can change it from one state to another by using an Interact action to touch the target. The mark can be scrubbed or scraped off with 5 minutes of work. If it's on a creature, it fades naturally over the course of a week. The time before the mark fades increases depending on your heightened level.
Heightened (3rd) The sigil instead fades after 1 month.
Heightened (5th) The sigil instead fades after 1 year.
Heightened (7th) The sigil never fades.

Emotion Enchantment Incapacitation Mental
somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Will; Duration 1 hour
To the target, your words are honey and your visage seems bathed in a dreamy haze. It must attempt a Will save, with a +4 circumstance bonus if you or your allies recently threatened it or used hostile actions against it.

You can Dismiss the spell. If you use hostile actions against the target, the spell ends. When the spell ends, the target doesn't necessarily realize it was charmed unless its friendship with you or the actions you convinced it to take clash with its expectations, meaning you could potentially convince the target to continue being your friend via mundane means.

Critical Success The target is unaffected and aware you tried to charm it.
Success The target is unaffected but thinks your spell was something harmless instead of charm, unless it identifies the spell (see Identifying Magic section on page 305).

Abjuration
verbal; Trigger a creature within range is falling
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 falling creature
Duration 1 minute
You cause the air itself to arrest a fall. The target's fall slows to 60 feet per round, and the portion of the fall during the spell's duration doesn't count when calculating falling damage.

[/spoiler]

Saving Throw Fortitude

By suddenly altering gravity, you pull the target toward you. The target is pulled 10 feet closer to you unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save. On a critical failure, it's also knocked prone. The effects of this spell change depending on the number of actions you spend when you Cast this Spell.

Creatures using an action to move onto the greasy surface during the spell's duration must attempt either a Reflex save or an Acrobatics check to Balance. A creature that Steps or Crawls doesn't have to attempt a check or save.
Target If you cast the spell on an unattended object, anyone trying to pick up the object must succeed at an Acrobatics check or Reflex save against your spell DC to do so. If you target an attended object, the creature that has the object must attempt an Acrobatics check or Reflex save. On a failure, the holder or wielder takes a -2 circumstance penalty to all checks that involve using the object; on a critical failure, the holder or wielder releases the item. The object lands in an adjacent square of the GM's choice. If you cast this spell on a worn object, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves against attempts to grapple them.

Abjuration
somatic, verbal
Range 120 feet; Targets 1 spell effect or unattended magic item
You unravel the magic behind a spell or effect. Attempt a counteract check against the target (page 458). If you succeed against a spell effect, you counteract it.

[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Invisibility ◆◆]
Illusion
material, somatic
Range touch; Targets 1 creature
Duration 10 minutes
Cloaked in illusion, the target becomes invisible. This makes it undetected to all creatures, though the creatures can attempt to find the target, making it hidden to them instead (page 466). If the target uses a hostile action, the spell ends after that hostile action is completed.
Heightened (4th) The spell lasts 1 minute, but it doesn't end if the target uses a hostile action.

For each additional action you use when Casting the Spell, you can fire an additional ray at a different target, to a maximum of three rays targeting three different targets for 3 actions. These attacks each increase your multiple attack penalty, but you don't increase your multiple attack penalty until after you make all the spell attack rolls for scorching ray. If you spend 2 or more actions Casting the Spell, the damage increases to 4d6 fire damage on a hit, and it still deals double damage on a critical hit.
Heightened (+1) The damage to each target increases by 1d6 for the 1-action version, or by 2d6 for the 2-action and 3-action versions.

Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You repel dangers from all around you, making passage through the chosen area safe for a brief amount of time. Anyone passing through the area gains the following benefits against harmful effects of the terrain and environment, including environmental damage, hazardous terrain, and hazards in the area. The spell grants a +2 status bonus to AC and saves against such effects, and resistance 5 to all damage from such effects. Furthermore, the spell prevents anything in the area that's prone to collapse, such as a rickety bridge or an unstable ceiling, from collapsing, except under extreme strain that would collapse a normal structure of its type.

Safe passage protects only against harm, not inconvenience, and it doesn't reduce difficult terrain, remove the concealed condition caused by precipitation, or the like, nor does it protect against creatures within the spell's area.
Heightened (5th) The granted resistance increases to 10, and the area can be 120 feet long.
Heightened (8th) The granted resistance increases to 15, and the area can be 500 feet long.

Duration 10 minutes
You repel effects that would hinder a creature or slow its movement. While under this spell's effect, the target ignores effects that would give them a circumstance penalty to Speed.

Duration 1 minute
You create an immobile sphere of force to either trap or protect the target, blocking anything that would pass through the sphere. The sphere has AC 5, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points. It's immune to critical hits and precision damage. Disintegrate destroys the sphere instantly. If the target is unwilling, the effects of the sphere depend on the target's Reflex save.

Critical Success The target disrupts the sphere's integrity, causing it to collapse entirely.
Success The sphere functions normally but has only 10 Hit Points instead of 40.
Failure The sphere has its normal effect.

[b]Encounter Abilities[/b]
------------------------------
[i]Agility Abilities[/i]
------------------------------
[b]Drain Bonded Item ◇[/b] 
Frequency once per day
Requirements You haven't acted yet on your turn
You expend the power stored in your bonded item. During your turn, you gain the ability to cast one spell you prepared today and already cast, without spending a spell slot. You must still Cast the Spell and meet the spell’s other requirements.
------------------------------
[b]Assured Identification[/b] 
Prerequisites expert in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion
You rarely misidentify an item. When using Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion checks to Identify Magic, if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead. If you would misidentify a cursed item because you roll a success but not a critical success, you simply can't identify it instead.
------------------------------
[b]Counterspell (R)[/b]
Trigger A creature Casts a Spell that you have prepared.
When a foe Casts a Spell and you can see its manifestations, you can use your own magic to disrupt it. You expend a prepared spell to counter the triggering creature’s casting of that same spell. You lose your spell slot as if you had cast the triggering spell. You then attempt to counteract the triggering spell (page 458).
------------------------------
[b]Courtly Graces[/b]
Trigger A creature Casts a Spell that you have prepared.
When a foe Casts a Spell and you can see its manifestations, you can use your own magic to disrupt it. You expend a prepared spell to counter the triggering creature’s casting of that same spell. You lose your spell slot as if you had cast the triggering spell. You then attempt to counteract the triggering spell (page 458).
------------------------------
[b]Linked Focus[/b]
Frequency once per day
Prerequisites arcane bond, arcane school
You have linked your bonded item to the well of energy that powers your school spells. When you Drain your Bonded Item to cast a spell of your arcane school, you also regain 1 Focus Point.
------------------------------
[b]Quick Identification[/b] 
Prerequisites trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism or Religion
You can Identify Magic swiftly. You take only 1 minute when using Identify Magic to determine the properties of an item, ongoing effect, or location, rather than 10 minutes. If you’re a master, it takes a 3-action activity, and if you’re legendary, it takes 1 action.
------------------------------
[b]Quick Recognition[/b]
Prerequisites master in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion; Recognize Spell
You Recognize Spells swiftly. Once per round, you can Recognize a Spell using a skill in which you’re a master as a free action.
------------------------------
[b]Recognize Spell[/b]
Prerequisites trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion
Trigger A creature within line of sight casts a spell that you don’t have prepared or in your spell repertoire, or a trap or similar object casts such a spell. You must be aware of the casting.
If you are trained in the appropriate skill for the spell’s tradition and it’s a common spell of 2nd level or lower, you automatically identify it (you still roll to attempt to get a critical success, but can’t get a worse result than success). The highest level of spell you automatically identify increases to 4 if you’re an expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 10 if you’re legendary. The GM rolls a secret Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion check, whichever corresponds to the tradition of the spell being cast. If you’re not trained in the skill, you can’t get a result better than failure.

Critical Success You correctly recognize the spell and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your saving throw or your AC against it.
Success You correctly recognize the spell.
Failure You fail to recognize the spell.
Critical Failure You misidentify the spell as another spell entirely, of the GM’s choice.
------------------------------
[b]Staff Nexus[/b]
Your thesis maintains that early and intense adoption of staves from the first days of study can create a symbiotic bond between spellcaster and staff, allowing them to create remarkable magic together. You've formed such a connection with a makeshift staff you built, and you are ready to infuse any staff you encounter with greater power.

You begin play with a makeshift staff of your own invention. It contains one cantrip and one 1st-level spell, both from your spellbook, but it gains no charges normally during your preparations; you must expend a spell slot to grant it charges in the same way you would add additional charges to a normal staff. You can craft your makeshift staff into any other type of staff for the new staff's usual cost, adding the two spells you originally chose to the staff you Craft.

At 8th level, you can expend two spells instead of one when preparing your staff, adding additional charges equal to the combined levels of the expended spells. At 16th level, you can expend up to a total of three spells to add charges to the staff, adding additional charges equal to the combined levels of all three spells.
------------------------------
[b]Inverted Pyramid Agent Dedication[/b]
Prerequisites Trained in Arcana. Member of the Inverted Pyramid.
You devote much of your time to the study of arcane magic. You gain two common or uncommon arcane cantrips and two common or uncommon 1st-level arcane spells added to your spellbook or repertoire. You also gain one 1st-level Inverted Pyramid spell slot. You can use your Inverted Pyramid spell slot to spontaneously cast any 1st level arcane spell in your spellbook if you are a wizard or known to you if you are not a wizard.
------------------------------
[b]Prescient Planner[/b]
General
Cost the Price of the chosen item
Requirements You haven't used this ability since the last time you were able to purchase goods.
You regularly create convoluted plans and contingencies, using your resources to enact them. You take 1 minute to remove your backpack, then carefully remove an item you hadn't previously declared that you purchased-you intuited that you would come to need the item and purchased it at the latest opportunity. The item must be a piece of adventuring gear, and can't be a weapon, armor, alchemical item, magic item, or other treasure. It must be common with a level no higher than half your level, and its Bulk must be low enough that carrying it wouldn't have made you encumbered.

------------------------------
------------------------------
[b]Encumbered[/b] 5 Bulk
[b]Max[/b] 10 Bulk
[b]Current Load Carried[/b] 2 Bulk

[b]Feather Token (Fan)[/b] 
Activating this feather requires you to fan it in a given direction. If this direction is toward the sail of a vessel, the feather flutters up toward the sail and fans continuously, filling the sail with air and granting the vessel a +10-foot circumstance bonus to its Speed for 8 hours. If fanned in any other direction, it instead produces a single casting of gust of wind (DC 20).

[b]Feather Token (Ladder)[/b]
When activated, this feather transforms permanently into a 20-foot-long wooden ladder.

[b]Perfect Droplet[/b]
affixed to armor or a weapon
Intense blue water magically holds its shape-a perfect sphere. The spell DC of any spell cast by Activating this item is 17.
[b]Armor[/b] You gain resistance 2 to water effects and attacks by water creatures.
Weapon After you cast a water spell by Activating the droplet, your body becomes mistlike. Until the end of the turn, you can move through enemies' spaces, treating each square in their spaces as difficult terrain. You can't move through creatures that have the water trait in this way.

[b]Signal Whistle[/b]
